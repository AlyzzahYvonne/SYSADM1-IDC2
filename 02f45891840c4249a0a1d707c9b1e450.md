**Course Reflection**

What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet,
exceed, or fall short of these expectations?

I expected the course to teach basic ideas about systems administration. It ended up being more than I expected because we learned advanced topics like Git, Kerberos, and centralized management. Plus, we did a lot of hands-on work, which made it more interesting.

What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?

We covered topics like the history of systems administration, managing services in Windows and Linux, physical infrastructure, print services, web server monitoring, LDAP, acceptable use policies, Kerberos, Git, and capacity planning. These topics helped me understand how to manage and secure IT systems and gave me both the theory and practice I need for this field.

Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
material?

The hands-on activities helped me the most. Using virtual machines to manage services in Windows and set up print services made it easier to understand. Also, reviewing my notes and practicing what I learned really helped me remember the material.

Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
effective?

The virtual machine exercises were the best. Setting up services and solving problems on a virtual machine felt real, so it helped me learn faster. It was great to see how things actually work instead of just reading about them.

Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How
did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them?

I found Kerberos hard to understand at first because it was complicated. To overcome this, I looked for tutorials, read more about it, and tried setting it up step by step. It taught me to not give up and use different ways to learn.

Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it
promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or
decision-making?

Yes, it did. For example, when monitoring web servers, we had to find issues, figure out what caused them, and fix them. This made me think critically and solve problems on my own.

Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or
perspectives did you gain from this course?

I learned how to use tools like Git and Windows Administrative Tools, and I got better at managing services in Windows and monitoring web servers. I also realized how important security and proper management are in IT.

How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your
future studies, career, or personal life?

I want to use what I learned to get better at systems administration and apply it in internships or jobs. I also plan to study more about these topics to improve my skills and prepare for certifications in the future.
